Description: The Ipe extensible drawing editor
 Ipe is a drawing editor for creating figures in PDF format.  It
 supports making small figures for inclusion into LaTeX-documents as
 well as making multi-page PDF presentations.
 Ipe's main features are:
  * Entry of text as LaTeX source code. This makes it easy to enter
    mathematical expressions, and to reuse the LaTeX-macros of the main
    document.  In the display text is displayed as it will appear in
    the figure.
  * Produces pure PDF, including the text. Ipe converts the LaTeX-source
    to PDF when the file is saved.
  * It is easy to align objects with respect to each other (for
    instance, to place a point on the intersection of two lines, or to
    draw a circle through three given points) using various snapping
    modes.
  * Users can provide ipelets (Ipe plug-ins) to add functionality to
    Ipe.  This way, Ipe can be extended for each task at hand.
