​  <description>
    <p>Ipe is a drawing editor for creating figures in PDF format.  It supports making small figures for inclusion
    into \LaTeX{}-documents as well as making multi-page PDF presentations.</p>

    <p>Ipe's main features are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Entry of text as LaTeX source code. This makes it easy to
      enter mathematical expressions, and to reuse the LaTeX-macros of
      the main document.  In the display text is displayed as it will
      appear in the figure.</li>
      <li> Produces pure PDF, including the text. Ipe converts
      the LaTeX-source to PDF when the file is saved.</li>
      <li> It is easy to align objects with respect to each other (for
      instance, to place a point on the intersection of two lines, or to
      draw a circle through three given points) using various snapping
      modes.</li>
      <li> Users can provide ipelets (Ipe plug-ins) to add
      functionality to Ipe.  This way, Ipe can be extended for each task
      at hand.</li>
    </ul>
